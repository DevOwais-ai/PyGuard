# PyGuard 🔐
**Python-based Information Security System**

PyGuard is an Information Security project developed in Python that demonstrates
core cybersecurity concepts such as packet sniffing, intrusion detection,
firewall rule enforcement, and automated response handling.

This project was built for academic and learning purposes to understand how
basic security mechanisms work at the system and network level.
